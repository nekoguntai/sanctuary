# Extensibility Architecture Plan

Last updated: 2026-04-11

## Validation Baseline

- `docs/EXTENSION_POINTS.md` identified sync/job queue ownership as a boundary risk before phase 1. The code validated this: sync routes mixed in-process `SyncService` calls, BullMQ worker enqueue calls, and direct blockchain sync through the legacy Bitcoin route.
- Frontend route gating was specific to Intelligence before phase 2. `AppNavFeature` only allowed `intelligence`, and the sidebar had custom Intelligence filtering logic.
- `server/ARCHITECTURE.md` is stale in places. It describes an IoC-style service registry, while the actual service registry is a lifecycle registry for managed background services.
- Existing registry patterns are real, but not all equivalent. Provider registration has health and failover semantics; import and device parser registries share priority/detect mechanics.
- Broad file-size modularization and a new plugin framework are not objectively justified by the current evidence.

## Objective Criteria

Architectural changes must make at least one of these objectively better:

- A future extension touches fewer ownership boundaries.
- Endpoint contracts stay stable while implementation moves behind a clearer service boundary.
- Startup/shutdown or dispatch order becomes testable instead of implicit.
- New direct cross-layer dependencies are blocked by tests or documented allowlists.
- Existing local patterns are reused instead of introducing a wider abstraction without evidence.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Sync Command Ownership

Status: Completed 2026-04-11

Goal: put manual sync, queued sync, network sync, resync, and legacy Bitcoin wallet sync behind one coordinator boundary while preserving endpoint response contracts.

Planned work:

- Completed: added `server/src/services/sync/syncCoordinator.ts` for user-facing sync commands.
- Completed: moved route-level sync orchestration out of `server/src/api/sync.ts`.
- Completed: routed legacy `/api/v1/bitcoin/wallet/:walletId/sync` through the coordinator without changing its response shape.
- Completed: kept direct confirmation update behavior stable while moving route orchestration behind the same sync command boundary.
- Completed: updated focused API tests so worker enqueue, in-process sync, resync cleanup, and legacy route behavior remain pinned.

Verification:

- Passed: `cd server && npx vitest run tests/unit/api/sync.test.ts tests/unit/api/bitcoin.test.ts`
- Passed: `cd server && npx tsc --noEmit`

### Phase 2: Route Capability Metadata

Status: Completed 2026-04-11

Goal: replace Intelligence-specific navigation gating with generic route capability metadata.

Planned work:

- Completed: replaced `AppNavFeature` with route `requiredCapabilities` metadata.
- Completed: added `src/app/capabilities.ts` for generic capability checks.
- Completed: added `hooks/useAppCapabilities.ts` to map runtime Intelligence availability into app capability status.
- Completed: replaced sidebar-specific Intelligence filtering with generic capability filtering.
- Completed: preserved the admin feature flag UI as a separate admin-only management surface.
- Completed: added tests for route metadata, capability filtering, and the app capability hook.

Verification:

- Passed: `npx vitest run tests/src/app/appRoutes.test.ts tests/src/app/capabilities.test.ts tests/components/Layout/SidebarContent.branches.test.tsx tests/components/Layout.branches.test.tsx tests/hooks/useAppCapabilities.test.ts tests/hooks/useIntelligenceStatus.test.ts`
- Passed: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json --noUnusedLocals false --noUnusedParameters false`
- Passed: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.tests.json --noUnusedLocals false --noUnusedParameters false`
- Existing failure: `npm run typecheck:app` and `npm run typecheck:tests` still fail on unrelated pre-existing unused-symbol errors in `components/AISettings/components/EnableModal.tsx`, `components/AISettings/hooks/useContainerLifecycle.ts`, `components/ui/EmptyState.tsx`, `hooks/queries/factory.ts`, `tests/components/UTXOList/UTXOSummaryBanners.test.tsx`, and `tests/components/WalletDetail/modals/ReceiveModal.test.tsx`.

### Phase 3: Architecture Docs And Guardrails

Status: Completed 2026-04-11

Goal: make the architecture docs match the code and add enforcement for boundaries that should not drift.

Planned work:

- Completed: updated `server/ARCHITECTURE.md` to describe the actual service lifecycle registry instead of a non-existent IoC registry.
- Completed: updated `server/src/services/DEPENDENCIES.md` to point new background services at `registerService()`.
- Completed: converted `server/scripts/check-prisma-imports.ts` into an explicit allowlist guardrail for non-repository runtime Prisma imports.
- Completed: added `server/tests/unit/scripts/check-prisma-imports.test.ts` for the Prisma import scanner and allowlist behavior.

Verification:

- Passed: `cd server && npm run check:prisma-imports`
- Passed: `cd server && npx vitest run tests/unit/scripts/check-prisma-imports.test.ts`
- Passed: `cd server && npx tsc --noEmit`

### Phase 4: Lifecycle Graph

Status: Completed 2026-04-11

Goal: make backend service startup/shutdown ordering explicit and testable.

Planned work:

- Completed: added `server/src/services/serviceLifecycleGraph.ts` as a pure lifecycle dependency graph helper.
- Completed: kept startup dependency ordering in the existing startup manager while moving the graph logic out of startup-only code.
- Completed: changed `stopRegisteredServices()` to stop in reverse dependency order, with reverse registration order as a shutdown fallback if graph validation fails.
- Completed: added focused graph and service registry tests for dependency order, reverse shutdown order, missing dependencies, circular dependencies, duplicate names, stop-error tolerance, and invalid-graph fallback.
- Deferred: migrating currently manual services from `server/src/index.ts` because validation showed the existing registered services have no production dependencies yet, and moving manual startup tasks would change their startup timing relative to database, Redis, migrations, and server listen.

Verification:

- Passed: `cd server && npx vitest run tests/unit/services/serviceLifecycleGraph.test.ts tests/unit/services/serviceRegistry.test.ts tests/unit/services/startupManager.test.ts`
- Passed: `cd server && npx tsc --noEmit`
- Passed: `git diff --check`

### Phase 5: Registry Helper Evaluation

Status: Completed 2026-04-11

Goal: reduce exact duplicated priority/detect registry mechanics only where the abstraction is smaller than the duplication.

Planned work:

- Completed: compared import and device parser registry behavior and confirmed the shared mechanics are duplicate ID checks, descending priority ordering, immutable snapshots, first-match detection, detector error handling, and confidence-sorted `detectAll()` results.
- Completed: added `shared/utils/priorityRegistry.ts` as a pure shared helper for those mechanics only.
- Completed: refactored `server/src/services/import/registry.ts` to use the helper while preserving import-specific parse behavior, validation behavior, file extension collection, errors, and logging keys.
- Completed: refactored `services/deviceParsers/registry.ts` to use the helper while preserving device-specific `null` parse behavior, JSON string fallback, stats shape, errors, and logging keys.
- Completed: added focused helper tests in `tests/shared/priorityRegistry.test.ts`.
- Completed: validated provider, export, notification channel, and script type registries as non-targets for this helper because their semantics are materially different.

Verification:

- Passed: `npx vitest run tests/shared/priorityRegistry.test.ts tests/services/deviceParsers/registry.behavior.test.ts`
- Passed: `npx vitest run tests/services/deviceParsers/deviceParsers.test.ts tests/services/deviceParsers/registry.behavior.test.ts tests/services/deviceParsers/coldcardFlat.branches.test.ts tests/services/deviceParsers/coldcardNested.branches.test.ts tests/services/deviceParsers/keystone.branches.test.ts tests/shared/priorityRegistry.test.ts`
- Passed: `cd server && npx vitest run tests/unit/services/import/importRegistry.test.ts`
- Passed: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json --noUnusedLocals false --noUnusedParameters false`
- Passed: `npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.tests.json --noUnusedLocals false --noUnusedParameters false`
- Passed: `cd server && npx tsc --noEmit`

## Deferred And Follow-Up Work

- Phase 4 deferred: migrating currently manual lifecycle services from `server/src/index.ts` into `registerService()` remains deferred until there is a specific service with dependency metadata that can move without changing database, Redis, migration, cache warmup, or server-listen timing. Before migrating one, add a startup/shutdown ordering test or harness that pins the expected timing.
- Phase 5 non-goal: do not fold `server/src/providers/registry.ts` into `PrioritizedRegistry`. It has async provider lifecycle hooks, health caching, timers, and failover semantics that are not present in import or device parser registries.
- Phase 5 non-goal: do not fold export, notification channel, or script type registries into `PrioritizedRegistry` unless their requirements change. Validation showed they are Map/capability/alias/dispatch registries, not priority-detect registries.
- Future follow-up: if another extension point repeats the exact ID plus descending-priority plus detector-confidence mechanics, use `PrioritizedRegistry` instead of writing a bespoke array registry.
