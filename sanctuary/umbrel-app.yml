description: >-
  Sanctuary is a watch-only wallet coordinator that helps you manage Bitcoin
  wallets without exposing private keys to any networked device. All transaction
  signing happens exclusively on your hardware wallet.


  **Default login: admin / sanctuary** (change after first login)


  Key features:

  - Multi-wallet support (single-sig and multisig)

  - Hardware wallet integration via WebUSB (Ledger) and PSBT files (ColdCard, Trezor, etc.)

  - Real-time blockchain sync via your Umbrel's Electrum server

  - Address management with receive/change tracking and labels

  - UTXO control for privacy-conscious coin selection

  - Transaction building with PSBT export for hardware signing

  - Multi-user access with role-based permissions (owner, signer, viewer)

  - Group permissions for family or team wallet management

  - Two-factor authentication with backup codes

  - Encrypted backup and restore

  - Dark mode and multiple color themes


  Supported hardware wallets:

  - Ledger (Nano S, S+, X, Stax, Flex) via WebUSB

  - ColdCard, Trezor, Keystone, Passport, BitBox02 via PSBT files

  - Any device that supports PSBT (BIP-174)


  **Note for Umbrel users:** Only air-gapped wallets using PSBT files will work.
  WebUSB (used for direct Ledger connections) requires HTTPS, which is not
  available to Umbrel containers. Use the PSBT workflow instead: export transactions
  to your hardware wallet via SD card or QR code.


  Sanctuary never sees, stores, or transmits private keys. Your keys stay on
  your hardware wallet where they belong.
